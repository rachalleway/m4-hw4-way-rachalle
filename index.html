            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Elizabeth Grant, better known by her stage name, Lana Del Rey, was born June 21, 1985 and is an American singer and songwriter. Her music is known for its unique cinematic sound and occurring themes of tragedy, romance, glamor, melancholia, and 1950s-1960s Americana culture and imagery. She has been accredited as being "one of the most influential singer-songwriters of the 21st century." She was raised in upstate New York and has spoke about her feelings of existential dread and alienation that she felt at an early age. According to Grant, "I had a sort of a philosophical crisis. I couldn't believe that we were mortal. For some reason that knowledge sort of overshadowed my experience. I was unhappy for some time. I got into a lot of trouble. I used to drink a lot. That was a hard time in my life."</p>
            <p>In her late teens, Grant became interested in songwriting and would perform in New York City nightclubs. Though she would sing and perform frequently, she never planned on pursuing a career in music seriously. While playing in clubs in Brooklyn, she began developing a devoted fan base in the underground scene, but states, "we were playing for each other at that pointâ€”and that was it."</p>
